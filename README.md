# Terminal-File-System

A small terminal file explorer for Linux. Written in Python Curses. Inspired by Ranger, Vim, and other terminal file explorers.

## TODOs

- Fix issues that occur when too many files are in directory/subdirectory
- Change directory of shell upon exiting script
- File type inference; opening files with correct program rather than just nvim for everything
